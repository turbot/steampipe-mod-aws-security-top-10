## Overview

The AWS Security Blog post [Top 10 security items to improve in your AWS account" contains tips for improving your cloud security](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/top-10-security-items-to-improve-in-your-aws-account) contains helpful tips to help you improve security in your AWS accounts.

In [Build a custom benchmark for the top 10 AWS security tips](https://steampipe.io/blog/aws-security-top-10) we show one approach to mapping the items from the blog post to Steampipe controls. This benchmark can be used as an example that we encourage you to [reuse and remix](https://steampipe.io/blog/remixing-dashboards) based on your security requirements.
